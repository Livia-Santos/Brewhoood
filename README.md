# BrewHood

#### A site to share and taste it your passion for homebrew beers.

This app was built with the main goal of learn,  understand and practice Ruby on Rails.

It was elaborated following the guidelines exposed by the course that I am currently doing at the Coder Factory Academy.

Hosted by: <https://young-crag-54781.herokuapp.com>

### Some Problems:

It is so hard to find people to give me an honest/professional feedback on my homebrew beer quality. (my mother opinion it's not so realistic ;) )

Find homebrewers that have the same brew level of skills that I have.

### What this app is for?

* Find and share homebrew beers.
* Support the homebrewer community.
* Share beers you are creating.
* Taste unique Beers.
* Know people who is passionate about beer.

### Setup on your local Machine
* Clone repository
* Navigate into app folder
* Make sure you have config variable for Stripe, Cloudinary
* run bundle install
* run rails db:migrate
* run rails server
* Type localhost:3000 on your browser
* Read to go!

### Planing Experience

* Some users stories:

  * In order to taste homebrew beer, as the one I am making, as a Homebrewer, I want to buy beers from people who produce beer for love and not for making money.

  * In order to compare the beer I am making with others at the same skill level I am in homebrewing, as a beer lover (and a homebrewer), I want to see for how long that producer is homebrewing.

  * In order to networking with other homebrewers, as I homebrewer, I want to see contacts and information about them.
